Mac OSX & Linux
-------------------------------------
1 - Start a new terminal window.  
    Click Spotlight (that magnifying glass top-right) and type Terminal.  Press Enter 

2 - Type in these instructions EXACTLY

mkdir ~/LingQ-Bulk-Upload
cd ~/LingQ-Bulk-Upload
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spattersongt/lingq/master/bulk_upload/selenium_approach.py -o selenium_approach.py
chmod +x selenium_approach.py
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install selenium

Both sudo commands will ask for your password.  Just type it in and press enter both times

If sudo pip install selenium fails try:

sudo -E pip install selenium

If you don't have easy_install, find the install instructions on the Internet.

Windows
------------------------------------
You're on your own. 


Create a Course in LingQ
--------------------------
I'll assume you know how to do this.  You need to get the course id.  You'll find this in the URL address when you're 
 viewing/edting your course.  

Example: http://www.lingq.com/learn/de/import/collections/152834/

152834 is the course id. 


Bulk Upload of *MULTIPLE FILES*
--------------------------------
This is useful if you have lots of lessons and want to upload them all at once.  

Zip up the files using your favorite zip program and move in into the LingQ-Bulk-Upload directory.  Then run:

./selenium_approach.py UserName Password Lang CourseId ZipFileName.zip

Example:

./selenium_approach.py spatterson NotMyRealPassword de 152834 StarTrekDS9.zip

Sit back and don't touch the FireFox window that does the magic.  Go grab a cup of coffee.



Bulk Upload of a Book
--------------------------------
*Note: This assumes you've converted your book to a text file.  Use some other software to do this*

Create 2 Text Files.  1 Text File has the entire book.  Each chapter is separated by the single line

NEW_CHAPTER

Especially long chapters should be broken up with the line

BREAK_CHAPTER

Then create another file (let's call it TOC.txt). Each line of the file should be the name of your lesson / chapter.

Example:

Chapter1
Chapter2 
Chapter3

Full example:

Book.txt Contents:
This is lesson 1
NEW_CHAPTER
This is lesson 2
And
it's
BREAK_CHAPTER 
a 
long 
chapter
NEW_CHAPTER
THis is lesson 3

TOC.txt Contents:
Chapter1
Chapter2
Chapter3

Finally run the command:

./selenium_approach.py UserName Password Lang CourseId BookTextFile.txt TOC.txt

Example:

./selenium_approach.py spatterson NotMyRealPassword de 152834 Book.txt TOC.txt
